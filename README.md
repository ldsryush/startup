*Font-style, font-size, text-align and put the desired change afterwards
header - flex: 0 80px - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
footer - flex: 0 30px - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
main - flex: 1 - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be flex and specify the flex-direction to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.
Flex is used to delimit the header, main, and footer elements. This makes them responsive to different screen sizes.
The use of absolute positioning relative to the parent element for the game controls.
The selection based on class attributes to style elements.
The override of Bootstrap in order to keep the menu from changing the flex direction to column on small screens.
The use of @media selectors to hide content when the screen is too small.
Learned about react and bootstrap.
How to deploy react and how it works with js. 
Component-Based Architecture:

React applications are built using components, which are self-contained modules that define the UI and behavior for a small part of your application. Components can be composed together to create complex UIs.

Virtual DOM:

React uses a virtual DOM to improve performance. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual representation of it. When the state of an object changes, React updates the virtual DOM first, then efficiently updates the actual DOM to match.

JSX (JavaScript XML):

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to XML or HTML. It allows you to write HTML structures within JavaScript code, making it easier to create and understand the UI components.

Unidirectional Data Flow:

React follows a unidirectional data flow, meaning that data flows in one direction, from parent to child components. This makes it easier to understand and debug your applications.

State and Props:

State is an object that holds data that may change over the lifetime of the component. Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes used to pass data from parent to child components.

Lifecycle Methods:

React components go through a lifecycle of events, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting. Lifecycle methods allow you to run code at specific points during a component's lifecycle.

Hooks:

React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Some commonly used hooks are useState, useEffect, and useContext.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
Winter sports have a high paywall that may intimidate some people from entering the sport. While there are lots of broad resell markets like facebook marketplace which lets people buy items second-hand at a discount of retail price, it is hard for first timers to research about the items and come to a good conclusion. My website will be a secondhand marketplace designed specifically for winter sport equipment. It will let users buy items at a discount while letting sellers get rid of their old unwanted items. There will also be a link using google image searching to give the buyer a link to a website that has reviews/specs for the product they are interested in to give them what they want.


### Design
![0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34bb3e93-7410-444b-a1eb-b6230855c7fb)



### Key features
- Lets users message each other about the item
- Direct link to research about their item 
- Let's people get over the high paywall most winter sports have
 

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Use the correct HTML structure for the application.Two HTML pages. One for login and one for creating links to the websites with reviews/specs for the product.
- **CSS** - Application styling to make it look good on varying screen size, good whitespace, color choice, contrast, layout, positioning, and fonts.
- **React** - Login form, navigation bar, home page, contact page. 
- **Service** - translation service, authenticating the user.
- **DB/Login** - Store users and searches in database. Register and login users. Credentials are stored in database. Can't message unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - chat application between users.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - I bundled using Vite after I changed the title to my name, changed the counter to increment by 10, and the background color.

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - I converted various HTML files into React components, utilizing useState for state management and useEffect for lifecycle events. The app includes components for login, play, marketplaces, input forms, media content, and selling items. I also integrated mock websocket and API calls from a mockdatabase. For 3rd party services I downloaded a json-server and created a mock database to use for information regarding password resets.  Consistent CSS styling ensures a responsive design, transforming static HTML into a dynamic, interactive React application.
- [x] **Hooks** - I implemented various React hooks to manage the state and lifecycle events of the components. For useState i implemented an authorization for login that changes between login/"welcome user". For useEffect I added an chatbox simulation that mocks a conversation between a potential buyer and the seller when you click on message seller.

- [x] **Calls to third party endpoints** - Called to third party endpoints in backend to fetch the local weather in orem to display in my homepage. 
- [x] **BackenD service endpoints** - user authentication that lets users sign up, reset password by sending reset code to backend terminal, and login to sell items and chat with other users.
- [x] **Frontend calls service endpoints** - user authentication also applies here as it uses both backend and frontend. Let users signup, reset password, certain things locked for only users like selling items and chatting!
