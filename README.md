header - flex: 0 80px - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
footer - flex: 0 30px - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
main - flex: 1 - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be flex and specify the flex-direction to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.
Flex is used to delimit the header, main, and footer elements. This makes them responsive to different screen sizes.
The use of absolute positioning relative to the parent element for the game controls.
The selection based on class attributes to style elements.
The override of Bootstrap in order to keep the menu from changing the flex direction to column on small screens.
The use of @media selectors to hide content when the screen is too small.

## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
Winter sports have a high paywall that may intimidate some people from entering the sport. While there are lots of broad resell markets like facebook marketplace which lets people buy items second-hand at a discount of retail price, it is hard for first timers to research about the items and come to a good conclusion. My website will be a secondhand marketplace designed specifically for winter sport equipment. It will let users buy items at a discount while letting sellers get rid of their old unwanted items. There will also be a link using google image searching to give the buyer a link to a website that has reviews/specs for the product they are interested in to give them what they want.

- **CSS** - Application styling to make it look good on varying screen size, good whitespace, color choice, contrast, layout, positioning, and fonts.
- **React** - Login form, navigation bar, home page, contact page. 
- **Service** - translation service, authenticating the user.
- **DB/Login** - Store users and searches in database. Register and login users. Credentials are stored in database. Can't message unless authenticated.
