>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch
Winter sports have a high paywall that may intimidate some people from entering the sport. While there are lots of broad resell markets like facebook marketplace which lets people buy items second-hand at a discount of retail price, it is hard for first timers to research about the items and come to a good conclusion. My website will be a secondhand marketplace designed specifically for winter sport equipment. It will let users buy items at a discount while letting sellers get rid of their old unwanted items. There will also be a link using google image searching to give the buyer a link to a website that has reviews/specs for the product they are interested in to give them what they want.
